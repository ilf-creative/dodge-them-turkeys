## Development

All you need to build this game locally is the [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/download). Then simply open the project.godot file in the project folder.

If you just want to poke around in the code take a look at the `.gd` files. They are [GDScript](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/scripting/gdscript/gdscript_basics.html) files which is basically weird python.

## Credits!!

### Code

This game was created following the [Your First Game](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/step_by_step/your_first_game.html) tutorial on the Godot website, and then expanding on that foundation a bit.
